# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_practice_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## What You Need to Submit
1. **Complete the `a1_practice_problems.py` in class**.  Mr. Berg will push solutions to github
2. **Complete the `a1.py` file** with your AI-generated problems and solutions
3. **Complete the reflection questions** in `a1_writeup.md`
4. **Push your changes to GitHub**

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

After completing your problems, reflect on:

1. **What was your initial experience with Python?** How did it compare to other programming languages you've used?
Python shared some simalarities with Java, which I am really familiar with; however, it's still a completely different langauge in the end. For example, the basic ideas of variables, data types, and loops remain the same, yet the syntax and the way they are implemented are significantly different between the two languages. Not only that, there are additional functions and and more ways to simplify the way to write code in Python, making it an overall simpler language than Java (doesn't mean it's worse in any way). There is a bit of a learning curve as I am learning the new syntax and way to use Python, but overall I am excited to learn more about how Python works. 

2. **How did you use AI effectively?** Give specific examples of good prompts you used and what you learned from the responses.
An example of good prompts I used was "I'm learning Python basics in a high school programming class. I have some experience with java. Can you create 5-7 practice problems that cover..." This is a good prompt because it is very specific, giving the AI and idea of what my experience with coding is and what exactly I want it to do. Additionally, when solving the problems it gave me, rather than directly asking for the answer, I used prompts such as asking for hints or asking it to tell me what I need to know without telling me the answer.

3. **What concepts were most challenging?** How did AI help you understand them?
The most challenging concepts for me was the actual syntax itself. Understanding what each function does and how I need to apply was the hardest part for me. AI really helped me with this as it fully explained what each function does and gave me examples of when and how I will use it. For example, learning how to get user input from the user through the input("") function, as it differs from how it is done in Java.

4. **What did you learn about collaborating with AI?** What strategies worked best for learning rather than just getting answers?
What I learned about collaborating with AI is just how helpful it is not as a geneie that answers all the questions you put in it, but as a tool for learning and understanding what I want to know. It is more important to me to not only solve the problem successfully, but to also learn what it is I am doing and how it works. AI can help me to achieve this goal as long as I am using it efficently and responsibly.
